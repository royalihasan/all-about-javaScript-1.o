# JavaScript Overview

JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language that empowers developers to create interactive and dynamic web applications. It was initially designed to enhance client-side scripting in web browsers, but it has evolved to become a crucial language in various domains, including server-side development with Node.js.

## Basic Concepts

JavaScript is characterized by its dynamic typing and immediate feedback during development. Key points include:

- Dynamically Typed: Variables don't require explicit data type declarations.
- Interpreted Execution: JavaScript code is executed directly in the browser.
- Integration with HTML: Code is embedded using `<script>` tags in HTML documents.

## Variables and Data Types

JavaScript offers various data types and ways to manage variables:

- **Variables**: Containers for holding data values.
- **Data Types**: Common types include numbers, strings, booleans, objects, functions, and undefined.
- **Variable Declaration**: `let`, `const`, and `var` are used to declare variables.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let name = "John";
  const age = 30;

## Array Methods

- `push()`: Add elements to the end of an array.
- `pop()`: Remove the last element from an array.
- `shift()`: Remove the first element from an array.
- `unshift()`: Add elements to the beginning of an array.
- `concat()`: Merge arrays.
- `splice()`: Modify an array by adding/removing elements at a specific index.
- `slice()`: Extract a portion of an array into a new array.
- `forEach()`: Execute a function for each element in an array.
- `map()`: Create a new array by applying a function to each element.
- `filter()`: Create a new array with elements that pass a test.
- `reduce()`: Reduce an array to a single value by applying a function.
- `find()`: Find the first element that matches a condition.
- `findIndex()`: Find the index of the first element that matches a condition.
- `some()`: Check if at least one element passes a test.
- `every()`: Check if all elements pass a test.
- `sort()`: Sort array elements.
- `reverse()`: Reverse the order of array elements.
- `join()`: Create a string by joining array elements.

## String Methods

- `length`: Get the length of a string.
- `charAt()`: Get the character at a specific index.
- `indexOf()`: Find the index of a substring.
- `substring()`: Extract a portion of a string.
- `slice()`: Similar to substring(), but also works with negative indices.
- `replace()`: Replace text within a string using a pattern.
- `toUpperCase()`: Convert a string to uppercase.
- `toLowerCase()`: Convert a string to lowercase.
- `trim()`: Remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.
- `split()`: Split a string into an array of substrings based on a delimiter.

## Object Methods

- `Object.keys()`: Get an array of an object's own property names.
- `Object.values()`: Get an array of an object's own property values.
- `Object.entries()`: Get an array of an object's own property key-value pairs.
- `Object.assign()`: Copy the values of all enumerable properties from one or more source objects to a target object.
- `Object.create()`: Create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.
- `Object.hasOwnProperty()`: Check if an object has a specific property as its own property.
- `Object.freeze()`: Prevent modifications to an object (immutable).
- `Object.seal()`: Prevent the addition or removal of properties, though values can still be changed (semi-immutable).

## Function Methods

- `call()`: Invoke a function with a specific `this` value and arguments.
- `apply()`: Similar to `call()`, but accepts arguments as an array.
- `bind()`: Create a new function with a specific `this` value and any pre-set arguments.

## Global Methods

- `setTimeout()`: Execute a function after a specified delay.
- `setInterval()`: Execute a function repeatedly at specified intervals.
- `clearTimeout()`: Clear a timeout previously set with `setTimeout()`.
- `clearInterval()`: Clear an interval previously set with `setInterval()`.
